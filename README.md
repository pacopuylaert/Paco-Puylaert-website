  <h3> Personal development of style </h3>
  <p>Calligraphy is a visual art related to writing.
  It is the design and execution of lettering with a broad tip instrument, brush, among other writing instruments.
  <em>A contemporary calligraphic practice can be defined as, "the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious, and skillful manner".</em> </p>

  <h3>Definition of Typography art </h3>
  <p>The term typography is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process.
     Type design is a closely related craft, sometimes considered part of typography; most typographers do not design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers.
     Typography also may be used as a decorative device, unrelated to communication of information.</em> </p>

        <p> People alwais sy that for me it is easy. I answer that make it look easy, but is has been a long process composed by many failures and little
          success. Time teaches everything.</p>
          <blockquote> Eight Modern Calligraphy Myths

If you’ve read the TPK blog for any length of time, you know that I truly believe anyone who wants to learn calligraphy can learn calligraphy! But: there are basic worries from learners/potential learners that often show up in my email inbox. I compiled the most common worries to create this list of the top eight common modern calligraphy myths.

If we’re being completely honest here, I don’t even know if some of these calligraphy myths are actually myths. They’re just misconceptions that I’ve gleaned from readers’ emails. However, it never hurts to address misconceptions! Even if you already know these “truths” are false, it will be handy to keep in mind that some calligraphy learners think this way. That way, you can encourage learners you interact with and help them to break through any barriers they’ve put up for themselves.</blockquote>

  <p> Spending time in your own head is important. When I was a boy, I had to go to church every Sunday; the priest had an incomprehensible Irish accent, so I'd tune out for the whole hour, just spending time in my own thoughts.
    I still do that now; I'm often scribbling down fragments that later act like trigger-points for lyrics.
